# Pandas Series

Welcome to the **Pandas Series** repository! ðŸŽ‰

In this repo, you'll find code examples, screenshots, and PDFs of the videos I created, all inspired by the Kaggle Pandas course I took. I believe the best way to learn is by teaching others, so I've compiled everything here to share with you.

## What's Inside?

- **Code Examples:** Practical implementations of various Pandas functionalities.
- **Screenshots:** Visual aids from the videos to help you follow along.
- **PDFs:** Comprehensive guides and notes that accompany each video.

## Concepts Covered

I cover a wide range of Pandas concepts, including but not limited to:

- How to create DataFrames and Series
- Indexing and handling missing data
- Manipulating data and performing operations

Pandas is an incredibly powerful tool for data manipulation and analysis, especially in the fields of ML and AI. I hope these resources will help you grasp these concepts more effectively.

## Stay Tuned!

I'll be providing a link to the video playlist soon, so stay tuned! I hope you find this repository helpful and enjoyable.
